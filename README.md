# to_bee_or_not_to_bee

In this project, we, 2nd year students of Fundamental and Computational Linguistics, **Anya Elagina**, **Sveta Kuznetsova**, **Timofey Dedov**, looked at the correlation of changes in the number of bee colonies depending on the US state, year (2015-2020), season and stressors affecting the number of colonies.



Results of our survey are presented in our presentation (*To bee or not to bee.pdf* and *To bee or not to bee.pptx*) and video(), where we explain graphics in the presentation.
